  My name is Travis and I am a Ruby on Rails developer from San Francisco, CA. For several years I have tinkered with different computer hobbyist things, and only recently I decided to get more serious about web development.
  %p< I joined and completed the Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco in June 2013 and since then have been continuing to design and code small projects. Prior to getting into web development I was an Acoustic Consultant for 6 years. It was a good time to learn how to be a good consultant and understand how to effectively work within small teams and directly with clients.
  %p< Feel free to click the letters of my name for small demos of technologies I like and am familiar with.
